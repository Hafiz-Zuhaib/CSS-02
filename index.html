   <p>Once there lived a wood-cutter in a village. He was very poor. He used to cut the trees in the nearby forest to sell the wood in the market. 

    One day, he was cutting a tree just on the bank of a river. By chance, his axe slipped and fell into the river. He was helpless. His axe was the only source of earning for him. He started crying bitterly.
    
    The angel of mercy appeared before him. He asked the woodcutter why he was crying. The woodcutter told him the whole matter. </p>
